Hello! I am a currently pursuing my Masters in Advanced Computer Science at [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/) in the UK. 

I am a very passionate individual who truly believes in continuous learning to equip myself with a wide range of skills and abilities. I always enjoy to build things which can have a significant impact in the real world. I also like to participate in Coding Competitions to improve my problem-solving ability. I regularly participate in coding competitions on different platforms. I am currently exploring Deep Learning and Computer Vision to contribute on some impactful projects. 

My passion towards learning led me to pursue a reasearch internship at [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/) which is one of the premier institutes in India where I have got to learn and improve many skills. I have organized a few intra-college coding contests during my undergrad to enhance the coding culture in the university.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
