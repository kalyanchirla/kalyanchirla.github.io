Content Aware Image Resizing is a feature which is used to resize an image without loosing the important content in the image using the [seam-carving algorithm](https://perso.crans.org/frenoy/matlab2012/seamcarving.pdf). An additional feature to remove any selected object from the image without distorting the image's content has also been implemented.
