- The objective was to analyze the problem of Burning graphs and finding the minimum time to burn a graph.    
- Implemented a heuristic-based approach to solve the problem on randomly generated graphs.
- Compared the burning numbers of a large number of randomized graphs to estimate the approximate value of burning number for any graph given the number of vertices and edges.
- Worked on Graph Theory, Algorithms, NP-Completeness, C++.
